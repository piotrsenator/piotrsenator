    <p>I work as an auditor, focusing on performance audits, strategic governance, and complex political issues. My interest lies in how public institutions function (and why they sometimes don’t).</p>
    <p>I have an academic background in engineering and political science, which helps me think across systems and scales. I’m fascinated by the ways large structures succeed, falter, or quietly adapt.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I walk: through mountains, cities, and ideas. It’s how I organise my thoughts, reconnect with what matters, and gain a wider perspective.</p>
    <p>The easiest way to get in touch is via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/senator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="linkedin-link">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
