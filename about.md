# About Me

I’m Piotr Senator – a systems thinker, strategist, and observer of patterns in society, technology, and nature.

I believe in questioning assumptions, embracing paradoxes, and walking slower to see further.

This site reflects a part of how I think, travel, and write — outside of job titles and career tracks.
